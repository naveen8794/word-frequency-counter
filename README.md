# WordFrequencyCounter
This is a POC for word frequency counter in a file.A program that displays how many times a word appears up in a file, or across files. The program is seeded with an input file where each line is another fileâ€™s relative path. Each file in the path will contain the words needed to be tracked. The program runs and lists all the words and their respective counts. 

## Steps to run the application:
   Assuming that you're running on a base OS
* Install JDK preferably 1.8
* Set PATH and ClassPath for Java
* Download the executable Jar file from the existing repo.
* Run "Java -jar word-frequency-counter.jar"
  * Input the file path for the program
